<p>Interview Question:</p>
<p>Is the following method thread-safe? How to make it thread-safe?</p>
<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="code">
<pre class="java">class MyCounter {
	private static int counter = 0;
 
	public static int getCount() {
		return counter++;
	}
}</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>This post explains a general interview question that has been asked by Google and a lot of companies. It's low-level and not about how to design concurrent program.</p>
<p>First of all, the answer is NO. The method is not thread-safe, because the <em>counter++</em> operation is not atomic, which means it consists more than one atomic operations. In this case, one is accessing value and the other is increasing the value by one.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11967" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/thread-safe-method1.png" alt="thread-safe method" width="400" height="280" /></p>
<p>When Thread 1 accesses the method at t1, Thread 2 may not be done with the method. So the value returned to Thread 1 is the value that has not been increased.</p>
<p><strong>Make a method thread-safe - Method 1</strong></p>
<p>Adding synchronized to this method will makes it thread-safe. When <em>synchronized</em> is added to a static method, the <em>Class</em> object is the object which is locked.</p>
<p>Is marking it synchronized enough? The answer is YES.</p>
<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="code">
<pre class="java">class MyCounter {
	private static int counter = 0;
 
	public static synchronized int getCount() {
		return counter++;
	}
}</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>If the method is not static, then adding <em>synchronized</em> keyword willsynchronize the instance of the class, not the <em>Class</em> object.</p>
<p><strong>Make a method thread-safe - Method 2</strong></p>
<p>In this particular counter example, we actually can make <em>count++</em> atomic by using AtomicInteger from the package "java.util.concurrent.atomic".</p>
<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="code">
<pre class="java">import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;
 
public class MyCounter {
	private static AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);
 
	public static int getCount() {
		return counter.getAndIncrement();
	}
}</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p><strong>Some other useful facts about thread-safe</strong></p>
<p>Local variables are thread safe in Java.</p>
<p>Each thread has its own stack. Two different threads never shares the same stack. All local variables defined in a method will be allocated memory in stack. As soon as method execution is completed by the current thread, stack frame will be removed.</p>
