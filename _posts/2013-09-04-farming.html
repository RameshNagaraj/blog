<p>Haalenahalli in Doddaballapur</p>
<p>The original plan envisaged incrementally adding milch cows and stabilise at around 20 cows in the first year; with this in mind, I created an infrastructure for 20 cows. One of the NDRI trainers under whom I trained, on a visit to our farm, advised me to explore NABARD for technological support. My interaction with NABARD made me realise that, to fully leverage the resources being deployed, we need to scale up the operation to 100 heads of cattle; this would create a capacity for 1,500 lts of milk every day and was projected to have an annual turnover of over Rs 1 crore.</p>
