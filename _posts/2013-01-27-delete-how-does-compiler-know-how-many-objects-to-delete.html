<p>delete[] p</p>
<p>The run-time system stores the number of objects, <tt>n</tt>, somewhere where it can be retrieved if you only know the pointer, <tt>p</tt>. There are two popular techniques that do this. Both these techniques are in use by commercial-grade compilers, both have tradeoffs, and neither is perfect. These techniques are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;font-style:normal;">Over-allocate the array and put n just to the left of the first Fred object.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>new char[10] could allocates a few extra bytes, put the number of elements at the beginning, then return the pointer to the first element after that. delete[] could then look behind the pointer at the stored count</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;font-style:normal;">Use an associative array with p as the key and n as the value.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>store the equivalent of std::map&lt;void*, size_t&gt;, and new T[n] would create a key with the returned pointer, and a value with the count. delete[] would look up the pointer in this map</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
