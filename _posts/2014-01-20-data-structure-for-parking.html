<p>What data structure to use for finding free parking spot in Parking Lot program? Assume there are million of parkings.<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Alternatively,</b></span><br />
Suppose We want to design a Car-parking system. where car can be parked in FCFS basis, But there are some Spacial person ,say P1,P2,p3..having a priority of x1&lt;x2&lt;x3. can be access car according to their Priority.<br />
Give the Data-structure to implement this. Derive Algo and Find Complexity.<br />
[Hints- Heap +Queue OR Multilevel Feedback Priority Queue OR Multiple Heap Structure ]<br />
How to ensure that starvation will not occurs ? How will you integrate with previous Data Structure ?<br />
[Hints -Ageing Technique OR use Time Stamp ]</p>
