<h5>How would you design an elevator algorithm ?</h5>
<h5><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Solution 1:</span></h5>
<h5><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_algorithm">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_algorithm</a></h5>
<h5><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Solution 2:</span></h5>
<h5>Elevator class: it has states such as up/down/stand/maintenance, current floor, list of floor requests sorted in the direction.<br />
Elevator bank class: contains elevators and receives requests from the floors. It has scheduling such as:<br />
if available pick a standing elevator for this floor.<br />
else pick an elevator moving to this floor.<br />
else pick a standing elevator on an other floor.<br />
else pick the elevator with the lowest load.</h5>
