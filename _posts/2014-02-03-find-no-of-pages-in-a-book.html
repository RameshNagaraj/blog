<p><strong>A book has N pages, numbered the usual way, from 1 to N. The total number of digits in the page numbers is 1,095. How many pages does the book have?</strong></p>
<p>Every page number has a digit in the units column. With N pages, that’s N digits right there. All but the first 9 pages have a digit in the tens column. That’s N – 9 more digits.</p>

<p>All but the first 99 pages have a digit in the hundreds column (accounting for N – 99 more digits).</p>
<p><a name="U60333876034379"></a></p>
<p>I could go on, but not many books have more than 999 pages. A book with 1,095 digits in its page numbers won’t, anyway.</p>
<p><a name="U603338760343IOH"></a></p>
<p>This means that 1,095 must equal:</p>
<p><a name="U603338760343WCD"></a></p>
<p>N + (N – 9) + (N – 99).</p>
<p><a name="U603338760343UII"></a></p>
<p>This can be simplified to:</p>
<p><a name="U6033387603436IG"></a></p>
<p>1,095 = 3N – 108.</p>
<p><a name="U603338760343HJG"></a></p>
<p>That means that 3N = 1,203, or N = 401. That’s the answer, 401 pages.</p>
