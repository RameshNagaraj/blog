<p>Answer: We'd answer "However many the market dictates. If pianos need tuning once a week, and it takes an hour to tune a piano and a piano tuner works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week 40 pianos need tuning each week. We'd answer one for every 40 pianos."</p>
<p>On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem">Wikipedia</a>, they call this a Fermi problem.</p>
<p><em>The classic Fermi problem, generally attributed to Fermi,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem#cite_note-1">[2]</a> is "</em><em>How many <a title="Piano tuner" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_tuner">piano tuners</a> are there in <a title="Chicago" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago">Chicago</a>?" A typical solution to this problem would involve multiplying together a series of estimates that would yield the correct answer if the estimates were correct. For example, we might make the following assumptions:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>There are approximately 5,000,000 people living in Chicago.</em></li>
<li><em>On average, there are two persons in each household in Chicago.</em></li>
<li><em>Roughly one household in twenty has a piano that is tuned regularly.</em></li>
<li><em>Pianos that are tuned regularly are tuned on average about once per year.</em></li>
<li><em>It takes a piano tuner about two hours to tune a piano, including travel time.</em></li>
<li><em>Each piano tuner works eight hours in a day, five days in a week, and 50 weeks in a year.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>From these assumptions we can compute that the number of piano tunings in a single year in Chicago is</em></p>
<dl>
<dd><em>(5,000,000 persons in Chicago) / (2 persons/household) × (1 piano/20 households) × (1 piano tuning per piano per year) = 125,000 piano tunings per year in Chicago.</em></dd>
</dl>
<p><em>And we can similarly calculate that the average piano tuner performs</em></p>
<dl>
<dd><em>(50 weeks/year)×(5 days/week)×(8 hours/day)×(1 piano tuning per 2 hours per piano tuner) = 1000 piano tunings per year per piano tuner.</em></dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Dividing gives</em></p>
<dl>
<dd><em>(125,000 piano tuning per year in Chicago) / (1000 piano tunings per year per piano tuner) = 125 piano tuners in Chicago.</em></dd>
</dl>
<p><em>A famous example of a Fermi-problem-like estimate is the <a title="Drake equation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation">Drake equation</a>, which seeks to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy. The basic question of why, if there are a significant number of such civilizations, ours has never encountered any others is called the <a title="Fermi paradox" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi paradox</a>.</em></p>
