<p>The DNA double helix consists of a long strand of four bases: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine">adenine</a> (abbreviated A), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine">cytosine</a> (C), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine">guanine</a> (G) and<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine">thymine</a> (T). Thus, it can be represented as a long string containing the characters A, C, G, and T. The field of bio-informatics involves storing and searching of DNA sequence data. What is a good data structure to facilitate storage and string match/search operation on this kind of data? Write a class that stores the DNA sequence and implement a method which takes another DNA sub-sequence and returns the position of this sub-sequence in the first DNA sequence.<br />
There are several linear time string matching algorithms. See<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_searching_algorithm">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_searching_algorithm</a> for a list of such algorithms.<br />
Often a data structure called Suffix Tree or PAT tree is used in DNA sequencing applications in the field of Bio-informatics. A Suffix tree data structure facilitates string match/search in <i>O(m)</i> complexity, where <i>m</i> is the length of the sub-string. It takes an initial <i>O(n)</i> time required to build the suffix tree.<br />
One concern with suffix tree is the high amount of space/memory needed. But, with a small alphabet ( only 4 characters in the DNA search problem ) , its not too bad. More over, there are some advanced techniques that can be used to further <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/321941.321946">reduce the storage requirements</a>.<br />
A thorough treatment of suffix trees can be found <a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~sahni/dsaaj/enrich/c16/suffix.htm">here</a>.</p>
