<p>There are n nuts and corresponding bolts. However, all nuts and bolts are shuffled and we have to device a technique to pair them.</p>
<ul>
<li>No two pairs are of same size.</li>
<li>Each nut has exactly one bolt for it.</li>
<li>You canâ€™t compare nut with a nut and same with bolt.</li>
<li>You can determine by a comparison if a nut is greater or a bolt is greater.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Strategy:</b></span></p>
<p>This problem can also be solved in a quick sort kind of technique.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick up nut n1 with all bolts. Divide all bigger bolts on one side and smaller bolt on other side. One bolt say b1 matches n1 to make the pair.</li>
<li>Take nut n2 and compare with bolt b1. If bigger bolt is required look in greater set otherwise in the smaller set.</li>
<li>Do the same with rest of the nuts. This way we are saving the number of comparisons by categorizing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Time complexity is approximately O(nlogn)</p>
