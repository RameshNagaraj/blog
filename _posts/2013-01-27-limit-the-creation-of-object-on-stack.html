<p>You can prevent an object being declared with automatic duration ("on the stack") by making its constructor private and providing a factory (abstract factory or factory method) to control creation of new objects.</p>
<p>To prevent accidental creation on the stack, make all constructors private, and/or make the destructor private, and provide friend or static functions that perform the same functionality.</p>
<p>Use the <a title="[10.8] What is the &quot;Named Constructor Idiom&quot;?" href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/named-ctor-idiom.html">Named Constructor Idiom</a>.</p>
<p>As usual with the Named Constructor Idiom, the constructors are all <tt>private</tt> or <tt>protected</tt>, and there are one or more <tt>public</tt> <tt>static</tt> <tt>create()</tt> methods (the so-called "named constructors"), one per constructor. In this case the <tt>create()</tt> methods allocate the objects via <tt>new</tt>. Since the constructors themselves are not <tt>public</tt>, there is no other way to create objects of the class.</p>
<pre>class Fred {
public:
  // <em>The <tt>create()</tt> methods are the "named constructors":</em>
  static Fred* create()                 { return new Fred();     }
  static Fred* create(int i)            { return new Fred(i);    }
  static Fred* create(Fred const&amp; fred) { return new Fred(fred); }
  <em>...</em>

private:
  // <em>The constructors themselves are <tt>private</tt> or <tt>protected</tt>:</em>
  Fred();
  Fred(int i);
  Fred(Fred const&amp; fred);
  Fred&amp; operator= ( const Fred&amp; fred) ;
  <em>...</em>
};</pre>
<p>Now the only way to create <tt>Fred</tt> objects is via <tt>Fred::create()</tt>:</p>
<pre>int main()
{
  Fred* p = Fred::create(5);
  <em>...</em>
  delete p;
  <em>...</em>
}</pre>
<p>Make sure your constructors are in the <tt>protected</tt> section if you expect <tt>Fred</tt> to have derived classes.</p>
<p>To prevent an object from being allocated on the stack define a private destructor. This results in a compilation error for a stack based object, as it prohibits the implicit destructor call when a stack based object goes out of scope. You will need to implement a public destroy method, something along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>void MyObject::destroy() const
{
   delete this;
}</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
