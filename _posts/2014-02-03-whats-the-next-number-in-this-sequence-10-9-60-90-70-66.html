<p>Spell the numbers out:<br />
Ten<br />
Nine<br />
Sixty<br />
Ninety<br />
Seventy<br />
Sixty-six<br />
They are in ascending order, based on the number of letters in the spelled-out numbers. A correct response will have nine letters: 96, for instance. A cleverer answer is "one googol." That’s the huge number that can be written as a "1" with a hundred zeros after it. Google, the company’s name, was originally a misspelling of "googol."</p>
