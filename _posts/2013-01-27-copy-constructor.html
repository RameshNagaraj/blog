<p>The copy constructor is a special kind of constructor which creates a new object which is a copy of an existing one, and does it efficiently.<br />
The copy constructor receives <strong>an object of its own class</strong> as an argument, and allows to create a new object which is copy of another without building it from scratch.</p>
<p>There are 3 situations in which the copy constructor is called:</p>
<ol>
<li>When we make copy of an object.</li>
<li>When we pass an object as an argument by value to a method.</li>
<li>When we return an object from a method by value.</li>
</ol>
