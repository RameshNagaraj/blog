<p>Steps to get the backtrace from the core file with the corrupted stack.</p>
<p>1. Run the gdb with the core file</p>
<p>2. execute 'x /512xg $sp'</p>
<p>3. Capture all the output into 1.txt file.</p>
<p>4. Copy the scipt.sh Â into folder which has 1.txt file.</p>
<p>5. Run the script. It would generate the 2.txt file</p>
<p>6. Open the 2.txt.</p>
<p>7. Copy the 20 lines from the file and execute those in the gdb console.</p>
<p>8. Repeat the step 7 for all the lines in 2.txt.</p>
<p>It will give the backtrace from the core.</p>
<p>script.sh ---&gt;</p>
<p>cat 1.txt | awk '/:/ {print $2 "\n" $3}' | sort | grep -v "0x00000000000*" | grep -v "0xff*" |awk '/0x/ {print "info line * " $0}' &gt; 2.txt</p>
