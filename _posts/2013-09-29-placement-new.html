<p>There are many uses of placement <tt>new</tt>. The simplest use is to place an object at a particular location in memory. This is done by supplying the place as a pointer parameter to the <tt>new</tt> part of a <tt>new</tt> expression:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;new&gt;        // <em>Must <tt>#include</tt> this to use "placement <tt>new</tt>"</em>
#include "Fred.h"     // <em>Declaration of <tt>class</tt> <tt>Fred</tt></em>

void someCode()
{
  char memory[sizeof(Fred)];     // <em>Line #1</em>
  void* place = memory;          // <em>Line #2</em>

  Fred* f = new(place) Fred();   // <em>Line #3 (see "DANGER" below)</em>
  // <em>The pointers <tt>f</tt> and <tt>place</tt> will be equal</em>

  <em>...</em>
}</pre>
<p>Line #1 creates an array of <tt>sizeof(Fred)</tt> bytes of memory, which is big enough to hold a <tt>Fred</tt> object. Line #2 creates a pointer <tt>place</tt> that points to the first byte of this memory (experienced C programmers will note that this step was unnecessary; it's there only to make the code more obvious). Line #3 essentially just calls the constructor <tt>Fred::Fred()</tt>. The <tt>this</tt> pointer in the <tt>Fred</tt> constructor will be equal to <tt>place</tt>. The returned pointer <tt>f</tt> will therefore be equal to <tt>place</tt>.</p>
<p><em>ADVICE:</em> Don't use this "placement <tt>new</tt>" syntax unless you have to. Use it only when you really care that an object is placed at a particular location in memory. For example, when your hardware has a memory-mapped I/O timer device, and you want to place a <tt>Clock</tt> object at that memory location.</p>
<p><em>DANGER:</em> You are taking <em>sole</em> responsibility that the pointer you pass to the "placement <tt>new</tt>" <tt>operator</tt> points to a region of memory that is big enough and is properly aligned for the object type that you're creating. Neither the compiler nor the run-time system make any attempt to check whether you did this right. If your <tt>Fred</tt> class needs to be aligned on a 4 byte boundary but you supplied a location that isn't properly aligned, you can have a serious disaster on your hands (if you don't know what "alignment" means, <em>please</em> don't use the placement <tt>new</tt> syntax). You have been warned.</p>
<p>You are also solely responsible for destructing the placed object. This is done by explicitly calling the destructor:</p>
<pre>void someCode()
{
  char memory[sizeof(Fred)];
  void* p = memory;
  Fred* f = new(p) Fred();
  <em>...</em>
  f-&gt;~Fred();   // <em>Explicitly call the destructor for the placed object</em>
}</pre>
<p>This is about the only time you ever explicitly call a destructor.</p>
<p><strong>What is <em>placement new</em> in C++?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In some scenarios it becomes necessary to place objects at specified locations in memory. Placement new solves this problem.</li>
<li>For example, there could be predefined memory pools in which certain objects need to be placed on creation.</li>
<li>Placement new is achieved by overloading the new operator which takes more than one argument apart from the default size_t argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>EXAMPLE: Demonstrate the usage of placement new</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class MyClass {

   public:

    // Placement new operator
    void* operator new (size_t sz, void* v) {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Placement new invoked" &lt;&lt; endl;
        return v;
    }

    ~MyClass() {
        // Cleanup
    }
};

int main()
{
    // Create a buffer to store the object
    int buffer[16];
    cout &lt;&lt; "Starting address of my buffer = " &lt;&lt; &amp;buffer &lt;&lt; endl;

    // Create the object. Use placement new
    MyClass* obj = new (buffer) MyClass();
    cout &lt;&lt; "Location of my object = " &lt;&lt; obj &lt;&lt; endl;

    // Don't delete object created with placement delete
    // Call the destructor explicitly
    obj-&gt;~MyClass();
}

OUTPUT:
Starting address of my buffer = 0012FF4C
Placement new invoked
Location of my object = 0012FF4C</code></pre>
