<p>Redirect Part:</p>
<p>When you click on a link of any tiny url, an HTTP Request is sent to their server with the full URL, like http // bit.ly / b9 (not a real one).</p>
<p>They read the path part (here b9), which maps to their Database.</p>
<p>In the Database, they find the real URL. Then they issue a redirect, which is a HTTP 302 response and the target URL in the header.</p>
<p>Encoding Part:</p>
<p>One of the most popular URL shortening services simply take the ID in the database of the URL and then convert it to Base 62[a-zA-Z0-9].</p>
<p>import static org.testing.AssertJUnit.assertEquals ;</p>
<p>public class TinyURL {<br />
private static final String ALPHABET_MAP = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789" ;<br />
private static final int BASE = ALPHABET_MAP.length() ;</p>
<p>public static String encode ( int IndexNum ) {<br />
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder() ;</p>
<p>while ( IndexNum &gt; 0 ) {<br />
sb.append ( ALPHABET_MAP.charAt ( IndexNum % BASE ) ) ;<br />
IndexNum /= BASE ;<br />
}<br />
return sb.reverse().toString() ;<br />
}</p>
<p>public static int decode ( String str ) {<br />
int Num = 0 ;</p>
<p>for ( int i = 0, len = str.length(); i &lt; len; i++ ) {<br />
Num = Num * BASE + ALPHABET_MAP.indexOf ( str.charAt(i) ) ;<br />
}<br />
return Num ;<br />
}</p>
<p>public static void main ( String[] args ) {<br />
//System.out.println ( "Encoding for 123 is " + encode(123) ) ;<br />
//System.out.println ( "Decoding for b9 is " + decode ("b9" ) ) ;</p>
<p>assertEquals ( "b9", encode(123) ) ;<br />
assertEquals ( 123, decode("b9") ) ;<br />
}<br />
}</p>
<p>I think this is more of a design question than a coding one.</p>
<p>We can think about<br />
- reducing the response time of the server<br />
---- by using a distributed system to share the load based on geography<br />
---- by using a central server but many caching servers at various geographical locations<br />
---- what would be the right database design</p>
<p>- reducing the storage space<br />
---- database design</p>
<p>- backup and failover</p>
<p>- security issues<br />
---- prevent people from creating links to ---whatever---</p>
<p>- handling old/obsolete urls<br />
---- may be, while creating the url we can say to the user that it will be deleted if the url is never used for more than say 3 years<br />
---- may be allow the user to login and delete unused ones</p>
<p>- how a company like bit.ly is going to make profit out of this service! how can that be improved</p>
<p>- user friendly things<br />
---- browser plugins to speed up creating links (youtube sharing has an option to create short urls)<br />
---- giving report to user about the usage statistics<br />
---- mobile app to create urls quickly</p>
<p>.....</p>
