<h4>Socket Workflow</h4>
<p>To establish TCP connections the server host calls <tt>socket()</tt> to create a listening socket then specifies the IP address and TCP port on which the server will receive connection requests with a call to <tt>bind()</tt>. Calling <tt>listen()</tt> puts the server into listening mode which then blocks on the <tt>accept()</tt> waiting for incoming connections.</p>

<p>The client connects to the server by calling <tt>socket()</tt> then <tt>connect()</tt> with a socket address that includes the IP address and TCP port specifying used for the <tt>bind()</tt> call on the server. On the server the <tt>accept()</tt> function returns with a connection socket descriptor when the client’s connection request is received.</p>
<p>After connecting the server blocks on a call to <tt>read()</tt> waiting for a client request. The client calls <tt>write()</tt> to send a request then blocks on a call to <tt>read()</tt> waiting for the server’s response. When the server is done processing the request, it sends back a response to the client. The exchange of requests and responses repeats until the client is done, at which time it closes the connection. The server detects this event when <tt>read()</tt> returns 0. The server responds by closing its end of the connection then returning to get another connection.</p>
<p>In most servers connections are accepted in one thread and a new thread or process is created to handle each connection. To keep things simple the example here describes an iterative server where each request is handled one at a time.</p>
<p>END</p>
