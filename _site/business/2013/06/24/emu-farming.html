    <h2>Emu <span style="color:#c30000;">Farming</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">The Emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), is the largest bird native to Australia It is also the second largest extant bird in the world by height.</span></p>
<div id="about-us-points">Emus can travel great distances, they sprint at 50 km/h (30 mph)</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">They feed on a variety of plants and insects and readily manufactured Feed</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Emu’s are large birds, they can grow up-to height of two metres (6 ft 7 inches) in height and weigh between 30-60 kilograms (66–132 pounds).</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Emu are now uncommon; by contrast, the development of agriculture, Emus are farmed for their meat, oil and leather.</div>
<div id="subheadings">
<h4></h4>
<h4>Emu Business Concept</h4>
</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Start Emu farm with maximum 1acre agricultural land which is not near residences</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">Purchase Minimum 30 to 50 nos of Genetic 3months old Emu Chicks from good Emu Farm Organazier.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Emu Birds are grown by group concept only ( 50 birds group need 90 x 160 feet space with 6feet height fence)</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Farm Maintenance should be very important with good Organic Feed, Purified Drinking Water.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Emu Bird 1stYield is only winter season &amp; After completion of 21months (in india October to March months)<img alt="" src="/assets/farm-img-2.jpg" width="300" height="160" align="left" /></p>
</div>
<div><span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">Average of 10 to 15 eggs can get from 1st yield and subsequently average of 20 to 25 eggs can get from next yields every year</span></div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Eggs Hatched By own Incubator , Egg Incubation duration from 48 to 51 days</div>
<div id="about-us-points">Chick Sale is a best profitable comparing Egg Sale</div>
<div></div>
<div id="subheadings">
<h4>Emu Farming – Farm Unit</h4>
</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Emu farming is usually done in UNITS, each unit corresponding to 1 pair, 1 female and 1 male. A typical small scale farming project starts with 5 units = 5 pair = 10 Emu's. In farm conditions it has been noticed that Emu's breed freely if the ratio of female to male is 1:1. To maximise profits some businessmen recommended clients to follow the ratio of 7:3, but it is not recommended by us.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">It is recommended that anyone interested in breeding Emu's for the first time get into the business with 30 females and 30 males. If, after learning how to manage the business, you see that you want to pursue it further, you can do so at a scale to suit your financial resources. If on the other hand, you find that you are not suited for the business, you can sell stock with little or no financial loss.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Remember, keep both good financial and production records or you will not know if you are making progress and a profit or whether you are losing money.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Areas having temperature ranging between 20°C and 45°C and relative humidity ranging between 55-65% throughout the year are ideal for Emu's.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Adequate facility for clean water, electricity, approach road, green grass will aid in successful breeding of the Emu's.</div>
<div id="subheadings">
<h4></h4>
<h4>Breeding</h4>
</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Emus form breeding pairs during the summer months of December and January, and may remain together for about five months. Mating occurs in the cooler months of Oct to March. During the breeding season, males experience hormonal changes, including an increase in luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels, and their testicles double in size.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">The female emu on very 2nd or 3rd day lays one of an average of 11 (maximum up to 20eggs) very large, eggs. A bird can lay 20-60 eggs in a season.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">The male becomes broody after his mate starts lying, and begins to incubate the eggs before the laying period is complete. From this time on, he does not eat, drink or defecate, over eight weeks of incubation, he will lose a third of his weight and will survive only on stored body-fat and on any morning dew that he can reach from the nest.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Incubation takes 45 days. Newly hatched chicks are active and can leave the nest within a few days. They stand about 25 centimeters tall and have distinctive brown and cream stripes for camouflage, which fade after three months or so. Chicks grow very quickly and are full-grown in 12–14 months; they may remain with their family group for another six months or so before they split up to breed in their second season</div>
<div id="subheadings">
<h4></h4>
<h4>Taking care of emu chicks</h4>
</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Emu chicks have distinctive bilateral stripes that help to camouflage them.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">The chicks achieve rapid growth, gaining their height by one year of age. After six months, the birds have shed most of their feathers for the fluffy, elegant feathers of the adult. For most climate conditions, the birds need shelter during the first few months. The birds are a very hardy and adaptable bird.<img alt="" src="/assets/farm-img-1.jpg" align="left" /></p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Chick survival rates in Emu are excellent. We cannot over emphasize the hardiness of the Emu. These birds have been traced back 80 million years.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="about-us-points">Usually, the eggs from your Emu are purchased by us and they are sent to incubators for incubation. The chicks are then kept in special sheds for a month and fed on farm feed before they are be sold to prospective customers.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h4>Important safety measures</h4>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">The farm should be ideally placed and away from the population.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">The housing should be proper with adequate breeding facilities.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">Proper disinfection procedures/foot dips etc., should be maintained.<img alt="" src="/assets/farm-img-4.jpg" align="left" /></p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">The quarantine sheds should be separate and away from other sheds.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">Routine disease monitoring procedures like postmortem examination of dead birds and periodic sera antibody assay is recommended.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">Water source should be tested for mineral, bacterial, chemical, contamination.</div>
<div id="right-points">The other birds (parent, commercial or pure line etc.) and pets should not be reared/allowed to enter the same farm.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">The breeding space should be optimum. There should be provision of showers, change over and dips.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">Proper storage of feed to prevent contamination should be made. The water quality should be checked periodically and if contamination is seen it should be treated with any sanitizer.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">There should be scientific facility for disposing off/destroying the bedding / dead birds etc.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">The equipment should be proper, properly disinfected and separated.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">The farm should have a water sanitation system.</div>
<div id="right-heading">
<h4></h4>
<h4>Fencing and Area</h4>
</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">Emu’s do not need sheds. Emu’s are bred in open space with wire fencing. This reduces considerably on the investment costs.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">A 10' X 20' size asbestos or thatched roofing should be provided for the EMU's to take shelter from rain and sun. The same will be utilized by female Emu's to lay eggs. Dry grass can be provided as a cushion for the eggs.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">Emu sheltered area should be kept clean by regular cleaning and disinfection to make it free from flies/mosquitoes.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">In case of open farmland proper fencing should be provided by the owner to prevent the Emu's from venturing out</div>
<div id="right-heading">
<h4></h4>
<h4>Emu food</h4>
</div>
<div id="right-points">These Birds are Omnivorous and eat leaves, vegetables, fruits, insects, worms. They can be feed Modified poultry feed.<img alt="" src="/assets/farm-img-5.jpg" align="left" /></p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">Emus drink about 3 litres of water everyday. It is important that fresh water be provided atleast 2 times a day. This will help the bird to retain body heat and cooling itself.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-points">Emu Feed is readily available in market</div>
<div id="right-points">Emu can also be feed on green vegetables</div>
<div></div>
<div id="right-heading">
<h4>Eggs</h4>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Eggs are dark bluish green in colour with a weight of 450 to 700 gms, which is roughly equivalent to 10–12 chicken eggs in volume and weight. A bird can lay 20-60 eggs in a season.<img alt="" src="/assets/farm-img-3.jpg" align="left" /></p>
